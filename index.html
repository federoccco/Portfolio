										<p>Since when I was a kid I always had been fascinated by data. I was going around the house thinking: 
											"Wouldn't it be cool if I could know how many hours did I sleep in my life? 
											How many times did I brush my teeth?". Growing up I understood that I couldn't go 
											back in time and start counting, but I could learn the tools to find the answers to those questions.<br>I slept for about 10 years of my life by the way.</p>

										<h2 class="major">My Journey</h2>
										<p>
											It is indeed true that I slept for about 10 years of my life, but what did I do while I was awake?
											My path was anything but linear. Growing up I developed several temporary passions which used to die after few months/years.
											I have been constantly working part-time while studying for the passion of the moment. 
										</p>
										<p> 
											I wasn't born with a dream. I wish I had one. Things would have been much easier. You know your path and you just do your best to follow it.
											I had to figure it out. "What do I like to do?" This is the question I asked every morning to myself for the past 15 years. I tried several things from sports
											to travel the world hoping to clear my mind and seek answers.  
										</p>
										<p>
											From elementary school to highschool I tried different sports like football, tennis and volleyball.
											I went to university without really thinking about it, I just believed that it was what I was supposed to do.
											The natural course of events. On my 3rd year, for the first time I stopped acting like a machine whose path was
											written by someone else and realized that maybe that wasn't truly what I wanted to do. (Spoiler: It was)<br>
											I dropped university and had some hard times. I was missing a purpose, something to achieve.  
											I started doing some part time jobs to earn some money while I was spending the rest ot the time experimenting and studying.
										</p>
										<p>
											I went to Japan in 2018 trying again to clear my mind and find something I didn't know I was looking for.
											It didn't helped to find my path, but it was the best eperienced I had in my life. 
											Learning a language and culture so distant from what I was used to really opened my eyes. 
											Once I got back, I tried to attend university for the second time, but after 2 years I again realized that wasn't
											what I wanted to do. Thanks to a friend I discovered back programming languages and started to learn it as a hobby
											until I realized I was learning it for so long that maybe finally I found my path. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Ironically, I closed the cycle right where it began doing the same thing I was doing when I started (my mother doesn't miss a day remembering it to me).
											I got passioned about data analysis and data science and here I am. Basically it's the 19 years old me, with 10 more years of self consciousness
											on my shoulder. I am hungry now, hungry to prove that all this time wasn't wasted, but it was what it took to make me the person I am.
